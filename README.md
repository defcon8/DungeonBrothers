===============

A cool opensource game inspired on a classic amiga platform game called Yo Joe by Hudsonsoft. This engine is
written in C++ using the SDL Library. Developed on Windows in Codeblocks IDE and compiled with the MingW. The game should be easy to port to other platforms.

Goals (momentary):

	- Fast and exciting gameplay
	- Tile based engine
	- Paralax scrolling background
	- Built in level editor
	- Keyboard and Joystick input
	- 2 Player Mode
	- Original amiga / tracker style music and audio FX
	- Aprox. 10 levels in different theme's
