===============

A cool opensource game inspired on a classic amiga platform game called Yo Joe by Hudsonsoft. This engine is
written in native C++ using the SDL Library. Developed on Win32 (DevC++) platform but should be easy to port to other platforms.

Goals (momentary):

	- Fast and exciting gameplay
	- Tile based engine
	- Paralax scrolling background
	- Built in level editor
	- Keyboard and Joystick input
	- 2 Player Mode
	- Original amiga / tracker style music and audio FX
	- Aprox. 10 levels in different theme's
