Dungeon Brothers
================

A cool open-source game inspired by Amiga platform games like 'Yo Joe!' and 'Ruff 'n Tumble'. The game engine
is written in C++ using the SDL Library. Dungeon Brothers is developed on Windows, in Codeblocks IDE and compiled with the
GNU GCC Compiler. Aiming to release the game for MorphOS and Windows. The game should be easy to port to other platforms.

The engine is shipped with an in-house trace utility called DungeonTrace. Which communicates with the application over TCP/IP.

Current status:
===============

The game is under development, still working on the engine. The engine and editor works with basic functionality. 


Goals:
======

	- Fast and exciting gameplay
	- Tile based engine
	- Parallax scrolling
	- Built in level editor
	- Keyboard and Joystick input
	- 2 Player Mode
	- Classic Amiga / tracker style music
	- Approximate 7 <-> 10 levels in different "haunted" themes
